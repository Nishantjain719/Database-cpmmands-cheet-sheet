It too expensive to ask Load-balancer each time where to route user request. so load-balancer will be maintaining the state of 
entire system(its like snapshot(ip addresses, port) of all the services and where they exist in which microservice boxes and how user can connect to them)
also its keep cordinating with gateway and every services in system and make sure they know how to send the request to correct area.
so load-balancer sends this info to gateway as snapshot and sanpshot will be perodically updated(lets say every 10 sec).
userFeed service runs on mutiple servers and depends on many other services like(posts or follows).
